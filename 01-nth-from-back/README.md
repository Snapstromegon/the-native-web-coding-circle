# The Native Web Coding Circle Challenge 01 - nth from back

This repo holds an example solution for the challenge from [this video](https://youtu.be/kPR3IWC0Wvc) by [The Native Web](https://thenativeweb.io).

## Solutions

This repository holds two solutions:

### [Recursive](./recursive.mjs)

This solution uses a recursive search and the stack to find the correct element.
It includes a detailed description in the comments of the function.

### [Iterative](./iterative.mjs)

This solution is what I expect to be the "correct" solution, since it matches the requirements and is already hinted at.
